# Database

A c++ compiler is needed to run this project.

The steps are as follows:
Save the code as a file name of your choice. I.E.  InMemoryDB.cpp
Open where you would like to run the project in a terminal or command line.
Navigate to the directory.
Compile the project with this line: g++ -o InMemoryDB InMemoryDB.cpp.
Run the program with the following code: ./InMemoryDB.



This assignemnt is essential to understand the basics of databases. I felt like this was one of the very few coding assignments in this course so it was a little tricky to follow. I beleive this assignment can be improved by adding more implementations to the database in order to make it fully functioning.
